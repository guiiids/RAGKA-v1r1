    "prompt": "A user complains that they get no final libraries on their Magnis instrument despite following the manual precisely. Which questions should I, an Agilent remote engineer, ask to probe how they prepared the samples?",
    "expected_answer": "To troubleshoot why no final libraries are being generated on the Magnis instrument, you should ask the following questions to probe the user's sample preparation process:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Input DNA/RNA Preparation\n- How was the input DNA/RNA quantified?\n- Confirm if the user used a Qubit BR dsDNA assay or Agilent NGS FFPE QC kit to assess DNA quality and concentration [5].\n- What was the input DNA volume and buffer?\n- Verify if the DNA was diluted in 1x Low TE buffer to the correct volume (e.g., 50 \u00b5L total) [5].\n- Was enzymatic shearing performed correctly?\n- If enzymatic shearing was used, ask if the input volume was 14 \u00b5L and if the fragmentation time was set appropriately on the touchscreen [4].\n- Was QC performed after off-deck shearing?\n- Ensure the user performed quality control on the sheared DNA before loading it onto the Magnis [4].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Reagent Handling\n- Were the reagents thawed, vortexed, and spun down?\n- Confirm if reagents were thawed to room temperature, vortexed horizontally and vertically, and centrifuged to ensure all liquid was at the bottom of the wells [2][3].\n- Were the reagents free from air bubbles or damage?\n- Ask if the user visually inspected the reagents for air bubbles or abnormalities before loading them onto the deck [3].\n- Were the probes dispensed accurately?\n- Verify if the probes were added to the probe input strip using an appropriate pipette, ensuring precise volumes (e.g., 5 \u00b5L or 2 \u00b5L for EPIS protocols) [4].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Deck Setup\n- Were consumables placed correctly on the deck?\n- Ask if the user ensured proper placement of tip boxes, HSM plates, and Beads & Buffer plates, ensuring they were latched into the spring-loaded mechanisms [2][3].\n- Was the Beads & Buffer plate seal inspected?\n- Confirm if the user checked for warping, bulging, or abnormalities in the Beads & Buffer plate seal [3].\n- Were tip boxes aligned properly?\n- Misaligned tip boxes can cause pipetting errors. Ask if the user checked their placement before starting the run [1][2].\n\n---\n\n### 4. Environmental Conditions\n- Was the instrument operated under the correct temperature and humidity?\n- Verify if the operating environment was maintained at 15\u201325\u00b0C and 30\u201370% humidity [3].\n- Were consumables stored under appropriate conditions?\n- Confirm if reagents and consumables were stored as per SureSelect guidelines and labels [2].\n\n---\n\n### 5. Protocol Setup\n- Was the correct protocol selected on the touchscreen?\n- Ask if the user ensured the correct input DNA concentration and quality settings were selected during run setup [4].\n- Was the \"Aliquot sample for QC\" option selected?\n- If applicable, confirm if this option was chosen during run setup [5].\n\n---\n\n### 6. Diagnostics\n- Did the user perform auto-teach before the run?\n- Verify if auto-teach was run to align the Z gantry and pipette. If auto-teach failed, manual teach may be required [1][4].\n- Were there any error codes during the run?\n- Ask if the user observed any error messages or abnormalities during the run [2].\n- Were leftover tips observed after the run?\n- Confirm if more tips than expected remained in the tip boxes, which could indicate a deck setup issue [1].\n\n---\n\n### 7. Post-Run Observations\n- Did the user inspect the deck and consumables after the run?\n- Ask if the user observed any abnormalities, such as leftover reagent volumes or issues with the Beads & Buffer plate [3].\n- Were QC results reproducible?\n- If the user performed quantification of failed samples, confirm if the results were consistent and not due to pipetting errors [2].\n\n---\n\nBy systematically asking these questions, you can identify potential errors in sample preparation, reagent handling, or deck setup that may explain the lack of final libraries.",

    "prompt": "I am observing high baseline noise and drift in a 7890 GC TCD. Provide me the top 5 causes and possible fixes. Show me documents from both the IKB and from user manuals.",
    "expected_answer": "High baseline noise and drift in a 7890 GC TCD can result from several causes. Based on the provided context, here are the top five causes and their possible fixes:\n\n### Causes and Fixes:\n1. Contaminated Carrier Gas\n- Cause: Contaminants in carrier gas can saturate traps, leading to high noise levels. This is especially common with nitrogen carrier gas [1].\n- Fix: Verify the purity of carrier gases. If a new tank was recently installed, test an older tank (if available) to see if noise decreases. Replace or regenerate traps if contamination persists [1].\n\n2. Septum Bleed or Inlet Contamination\n- Cause: Septum bleed from low molecular weight materials or contaminants in the inlet can contribute to baseline noise [1], [3].\n- Fix: Bakeout the inlet to reduce septum bleed and contaminants. Use high-quality septa stored properly to avoid contamination [1], [3].\n\n3. Loose Connections or Signal Path Issues\n- Cause: Loose connections in the detector or its signal path can generate noise [1].\n- Fix: Inspect all connections for tightness and verify proper reassembly after recent maintenance [1].\n\n4. Environmental Factors (Air Currents)\n- Cause: Air currents from fans or air conditioners blowing across the GC may interfere with gas exiting the detector, causing fluctuations [1].\n- Fix: Switch off air current sources near the GC or shield the detector exit to minimize interference [1].\n\n5. Detector Contamination\n- Cause: Gradual contamination of the detector can lead to unacceptable noise levels over time [2], [3].\n- Fix: Inspect and clean/bake out contaminated detectors as needed (FID, TCD, uECD). Replace parts if necessary following guidance in maintenance manuals like Agilent's 7890 Series Troubleshooting guide [2], [3].\n\n### Relevant Documents:\n- From IKB:\n* \"Frequent GC Issues\" article discusses troubleshooting strategies for high detector background/noise/spikes and related problems such as column bleed and environmental factors affecting performance ([2]).\n- From User Manuals:\n* Agilent 7890 Series Troubleshooting manual provides detailed steps for bakeout procedures, leak checking at column fittings, and addressing noisy baselines ([1], [3]).\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification!",

Below are detailed instructions to investigate and address this issue:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Confirm Symptoms\n- Observation: High baseline noise or drift, particularly when the inlet temperature is high.\n- Verification: Lower the inlet temperature temporarily and observe if the noise decreases. If it does, septum bleed is a likely cause [1].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Inspect the Septum\n- Action: Check the septum for signs of wear, contamination, or improper installation.\n- Recommendation: Use only high-quality septa designed for your GC system. Store them in a clean, contamination-free environment [1].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Perform Bakeout\n- Purpose: Bakeout helps remove contaminants, including bleed from low molecular weight materials.\n- Steps:\n1. Access the bakeout procedure specific to your GC system (e.g., Split/Splitless Inlet Bakeout).\n2. Follow the instructions in the user manual or maintenance guide to initiate the bakeout process [1], [2].\n\n---\n\n### 4. Replace the Septum\n- Action: If the septum is visibly damaged or contaminated, replace it with a new one.\n- Steps:\n1. Shut down the GC system and allow it to cool.\n2. Remove the old septum carefully to avoid introducing contaminants.\n3. Install the new septum securely, ensuring it is seated properly [1].\n\n---\n\n### 5. Test the System\n- Action: After replacing the septum and performing bakeout, restart the GC system.\n- Verification: Run a test sample to confirm that baseline noise has decreased. Monitor the system for any recurring issues [1].\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Preventive Measures: Regularly inspect and replace the septum as part of routine maintenance.\n- Documentation: Record the steps taken and any observations for future reference.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively investigate and resolve septum bleed issues in your GC system.
