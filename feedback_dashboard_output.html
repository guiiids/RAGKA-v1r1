Find the Relevant Billing Event: Identify the billing event that contains the invoice(s) you want to detach.3. Open the Invoice: Click on the appropriate invoice link to display all invoices within that billing event. Select the magnifying glass icon next to the specific invoice you wish to detach.4. Detach Invoice:   - Once the invoice is open, click on the &quot;Detach Invoice&quot; icon at the top of the page.   - A Detach Invoice window will appear where you can optionally add a note in the provided field.   - Click &quot;Detach Invoice&quot; to remove it from this billing event.5. Confirmation: After detaching, a note stating that the invoice has been detached will display at the top of its view [1], [2].Keep in mind:- Detached invoices retain their original number and details.- Certain criteria prevent detachment (e.g., if marked as Paid or Partially Paid, or if associated with a completed billing event sent for final processing) [1].
