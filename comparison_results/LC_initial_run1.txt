QUERY:
How do I fix a leak between needle and Needle Seat in G1367A Autosampler?

================================================================================

ACTUAL RESPONSE:
To fix a leak between the needle and needle seat in the G1367A Autosampler, follow these steps:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Close the shutoff valves in the pump or remove the tubing from solvent bottles to prevent leaks [2].
   - Ensure you wear safety goggles and gloves to avoid injury from the uncovered needle [2].

2. **Start Maintenance Mode**:
   - In the user interface, start the maintenance mode and select the "Change needle/seat" function. Alternatively, use the Agilent Lab Advisor software under the "Tools" section [2].

3. **Access the Needle Seat**:
   - Open the front door of the autosampler [2].
   - Disconnect the seat capillary from the injection valve [2].

4. **Remove the Needle Seat**:
   - Carefully lift out the needle seat from its holder using a flat-head screwdriver [2].

5. **Inspect and Replace**:
   - Inspect the needle seat for visible damage or blockage. If damaged, replace it with a new needle seat (part number G1367-87012) [2].
   - Insert the new needle seat and press it firmly into position [2].

6. **Reassemble**:
   - Reconnect the seat capillary to the injection valve [2].
   - Exit the maintenance mode and close the front door [2].

7. **Testing**:
   - Perform a hydraulic path leak test to ensure the issue is resolved [3].

If the leak persists after replacing the needle seat, consider backflushing the needle seat or sonicate it upside down in hot water or a suitable solvent to remove any blockages [1].

EXPECTED RESPONSE:
To fix a leak between the needle and the needle seat in the G1367A Autosampler, follow these steps:1. Inspect for Damage or Blockage: Check if the needle seat is visibly damaged, blocked, or leaking. You can use an eyeglass to inspect for scoring on the needle seat [1].2. Backflush Needle Seat:- Remove the ALS outlet capillary and needle seat capillary.- Connect the needle seat capillary to port 6 of the injection valve or join it with a union to reverse flow direction through the needle seat.- Dial up a flow rate of 0.5â€“1 ml/min on the pump and open its purge valve.- While purging, lift the needle out using maintenance software (e.g., OpenLab Advisor or ChemStation) to expose it.- Place tissues around to mop up any mobile phase leakage near sensitive areas like leak sensors [1].3. Sonicate Needle Seat:- If backflushing does not resolve the issue, remove and sonicate the needle seat upside down in hot water or 100% B-phase solvent to dissolve any precipitation [1].4. Replace Needle Seat:- If cleaning does not fix leaks, replace both the needle and needle seat as a matching pair to ensure proper sealing [2], [3].- Use tools such as a flathead screwdriver and wrench (p/n 8710-0510). Carefully remove and insert a new high-pressure PEEK-based needle seat (e.g., p/n G1367-87012) into position [4].5. Safety Precautions:- Wear appropriate PPE as described in material safety data sheets provided by chemical vendors.- Be cautious of uncovered needles during handling; use silicon safety tubes supplied with new needles [2], [4].
