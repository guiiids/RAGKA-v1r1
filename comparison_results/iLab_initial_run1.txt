QUERY:
How do I detach an invoice from a billing file in iLab?

================================================================================

ACTUAL RESPONSE:
To detach an invoice from a billing file in iLab, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Billing tab** in the core facility to view your list of existing billing events. Ensure the billing event has a status of either "Billing Initialized" or "Draft."
2. Locate the billing event that contains the invoice(s) you want to detach and click on the appropriate invoice link to display a list of all invoices within that billing event.
3. Open the specific invoice you wish to detach by selecting the magnifying glass icon to the far right.
4. Once the invoice is open, select the **"Detach Invoice" icon** at the top of the invoice.
5. The **Detach Invoice window** will open. You may enter a note in the provided field (optional).
6. Click **"Detach Invoice"** to remove the invoice from the billing event. A note indicating that the invoice has been detached will display at the top of the invoice [1].

After detachment, the invoice will move to a new section called **View Detached Invoices**, found under the core facility's Billing tab. Detached invoices can also be filtered and aggregated using the filter panel for easy management [1].
