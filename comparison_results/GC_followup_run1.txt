QUERY:
Provide detailed instructions for investigating root cause #2.

================================================================================

ACTUAL RESPONSE:
To investigate **root cause #2 (Gas Purity Issues)**, follow these detailed steps based on the provided context:

### **Steps to Investigate and Resolve Gas Purity Issues**
1. **Verify the Purity of Carrier and Detector Gases**:
   - Check the specifications of the gas being used. Ensure it meets the required purity standards for your GC system.
   - If a new gas tank was recently installed, try using an older tank (if available) to see if the noise decreases [1].

2. **Inspect the Gas Supply System**:
   - Examine the gas supply lines for any contamination or leaks.
   - Ensure that the gas traps (e.g., moisture and oxygen traps) are functioning effectively. Replace or regenerate traps if they are saturated [1].

3. **Test the Gas Quality**:
   - If the new gas is suspected to be contaminated, it may saturate the traps. Switching back to an older tank can help confirm whether the new gas is the issue [1].
   - If switching tanks does not resolve the problem, replace the traps or regenerate them to ensure they are not compromised.

4. **Check Environmental Factors**:
   - Ensure the GC system is not exposed to environmental factors that could interfere with the gas supply, such as air currents from fans or air conditioners. Shield the detector exit if necessary [1].

5. **Consult a Reliable Gas Supplier**:
   - If the issue persists, contact your gas supplier to verify the quality of the gas and ensure it meets the required specifications for GC operation [1].

### **Additional Notes**
- If the gas purity issue is resolved but the baseline noise persists, consider other potential causes such as detector contamination or column issues.
- Regular maintenance of the gas supply system and traps can prevent gas-related problems in the future.

These steps should help identify and resolve gas purity issues effectively. Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!

EXPECTED RESPONSE:
### Investigating Root Cause #2: Septum BleedSeptum bleed is a common issue that can contribute to high baseline noise in GC systems. Below are detailed instructions to investigate and address this issue:---### 1. Confirm Symptoms- Observation: High baseline noise or drift, particularly when the inlet temperature is high.- Verification: Lower the inlet temperature temporarily and observe if the noise decreases. If it does, septum bleed is a likely cause [1].---### 2. Inspect the Septum- Action: Check the septum for signs of wear, contamination, or improper installation.- Recommendation: Use only high-quality septa designed for your GC system. Store them in a clean, contamination-free environment [1].---### 3. Perform Bakeout- Purpose: Bakeout helps remove contaminants, including bleed from low molecular weight materials.- Steps:1. Access the bakeout procedure specific to your GC system (e.g., Split/Splitless Inlet Bakeout).2. Follow the instructions in the user manual or maintenance guide to initiate the bakeout process [1], [2].---### 4. Replace the Septum- Action: If the septum is visibly damaged or contaminated, replace it with a new one.- Steps:1. Shut down the GC system and allow it to cool.2. Remove the old septum carefully to avoid introducing contaminants.3. Install the new septum securely, ensuring it is seated properly [1].---### 5. Test the System- Action: After replacing the septum and performing bakeout, restart the GC system.- Verification: Run a test sample to confirm that baseline noise has decreased. Monitor the system for any recurring issues [1].
