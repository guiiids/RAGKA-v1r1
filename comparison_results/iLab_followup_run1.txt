QUERY:
How can I undo this and reattach an invoice?

================================================================================

ACTUAL RESPONSE:
To reattach a detached invoice in iLab, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Billing tab** in the core facility and locate the section called **View Detached Invoices**. Detached invoices can also be found within the "Invoices" link in the left-hand navigation menu [1].
2. Use the filter tools within the Invoices filter panel to search for detached invoices, which are easily identifiable by their red-lettered "Detached" status [1].
3. Select the checkbox next to the detached invoice you want to reattach.
4. The detached invoice will automatically be moved into the next **Billing Event** created for inclusion. Selecting the checkbox ensures the invoice is inserted into the new billing event [1].

This process allows you to include the previously detached invoice in a new billing event for further processing.
