# Improved RAG System for Procedural Content

This implementation enhances the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to better handle procedural content, such as step-by-step instructions and guides.

## Problem Addressed

The original RAG system had issues with procedural content:
- Responses lacked logical step-by-step structure
- Important details from source documentation were omitted
- The hierarchical nature of procedures was not preserved
- The system didn't distinguish between procedural and informational queries

## Key Improvements

1. **Semantic Chunking**: Documents are now chunked by semantic boundaries (headers, sections, steps) to preserve structure
2. **Procedural Content Detection**: The system can now identify when content contains procedural elements
3. **Hierarchical Retrieval**: Search results are reorganized to preserve document hierarchy
4. **Context Preparation Enhancements**: Procedural content is formatted differently to maintain structure
5. **Query Type Detection**: The system detects if a query is asking for procedural information
6. **Specialized System Prompts**: Different prompts are used for procedural vs. informational queries

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation follows a phased approach as outlined in `rag_improvement_plan.md`:

1. **Phase 1**: Improved Chunking Strategy (COMPLETED)
2. **Phase 2**: Context Preparation Enhancements (PLANNED)
3. **Phase 3**: System Prompt Improvements (PLANNED)
4. **Phase 4**: Response Validation and Post-Processing (PLANNED)
5. **Phase 5**: Metadata-Enhanced Retrieval (PLANNED)
6. **Phase 6**: Integration and Testing (PLANNED)

## File Structure

- `rag_improvement_plan.md` - Detailed implementation plan with phases and checkpoints
- `rag_improvement_logging.py` - Dedicated logging configuration for the improvement process
- `rag_assistant_with_history_alternate.py` - Improved RAG implementation
- `main_alternate.py` - Alternate version of main.py that uses the improved RAG implementation
- `test_rag_improvement.py` - Test script to verify the implementation

## How to Use

### Running the Improved RAG System

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the alternate main application:
   ```
   python main_alternate.py
   ```

3. Access the application in your browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5004
   ```

### Testing the Implementation

Run the test script to verify the implementation:
```
python test_rag_improvement.py
```

This will run all the tests for Phase 1 and provide a summary of the results.

### Comparing with Original Implementation

To compare the improved implementation with the original:

1. Run the original implementation:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Run the improved implementation:
   ```
   python main_alternate.py
   ```

3. Test both implementations with the same procedural queries, such as:
   - "how to add a new calendar?"
   - "what are the steps to configure calendar permissions?"
   - "guide to setting up a calendar"

## Logging

All changes and test results are logged to a dedicated log file:
```
logs/rag_improvement_logs.log
```

The logs include:
- `[PHASE-X]` prefix for each log entry to indicate the implementation phase
- `[CHECKPOINT-X]` prefix for checkpoint validation logs
- `[TEST]` prefix for test results
- `[COMPARE]` prefix for comparison between original and improved responses

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 2: Context Preparation Enhancements
2. Implement Phase 3: System Prompt Improvements
3. Add Response Validation and Post-Processing (Phase 4)
4. Enhance Retrieval with Metadata (Phase 5)
5. Perform comprehensive testing and fine-tuning (Phase 6)

## Rollback Strategy

If issues are encountered during implementation:

1. Identify the phase where the issue was introduced
2. Revert changes in the alternate files to the last working checkpoint
3. Log the issue and the rollback action
4. Modify the approach before proceeding

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Procedural responses include clear, numbered steps
2. The hierarchical structure of procedures is preserved
3. All critical information from the source documentation is included
4. The system properly distinguishes between procedural and informational queries
5. Response quality is improved as measured by user feedback
