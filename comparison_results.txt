## How to Add a New Calendar

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have access to the calendar management interface.
- Confirm that you have the necessary permissions to create and edit calendars.

### Steps to Add a New Calendar
1. **Access the Calendar Settings**:
   - Navigate to the section where calendar settings are managed. This may involve clicking on the relevant menu or tab within your system interface.

2. **Enter Basic Information**:
   - **Schedule Name**: Provide a name for the calendar. This will help users identify it easily [1].
   - **Scheduled Resource Description**: Add a description for the resource. This text will be displayed to customers on the calendar interface and can include explanations, images, billing information, or scheduling directions [1].
   - **Category**: Group the calendar into a category if needed. To create a new category:
     - Click on the category dropdown.
     - Select "Add new category."
     - Type the name of the new category in the free text field below. Note: If you want calendars displayed in categories, you may need to contact iLab to enable an additional setting [1].
   - **Time Zone**: Specify the time zone for scheduling purposes. By default, this will be set to your institution's time zone, but it can override the user's personal time zone setting [1].
   - **Classification**: Assign a classification to the schedule to make it easier to search. Available classification terms are derived from the Eagle I Resource Ontology Set [1].

3. **Add Calendar Notes**:
   - Include any notes that should appear above the calendar on the "View Schedule" page. These notes can provide additional context or instructions for users [1].

4. **Set Customer Instructions for Reservation Details**:
   - Enter instructions that will be displayed to customers at the top of the Reservation Details page. These instructions can guide users on how to complete their reservations [1].

5. **Configure Multiple Instances (Optional)**:
   - If you need to create multiple calendars within a single interface (e.g., for multiple resources like PCR machines), use the "Configure Multiple Instances" section. Enter each resource as a separate row with distinct names (e.g., "PCR 1," "PCR 2," etc.) [2].

6. **Save the Calendar**:
   - Save each editing panel individually to ensure all settings are applied correctly. Hover over the "i" icon beside fields to review help text if needed [1].

### Verification
- Check the calendar interface to ensure the new calendar appears with the correct settings and information.
- Verify that the calendar is accessible and displays properly to users.

### Troubleshooting
- If the calendar does not display correctly, ensure all required fields were completed during setup.
- Contact iLab support if additional settings (e.g., categories or advanced attributes) need to be enabled [1].

By following these steps, you can successfully add a new calendar to your system.

Permission groups allow\n\nthe core to assign users to different groups and then add those groups to usage types that will\n\nenable or limit access to a calendar. Permission groups are not hierarchical and can be assigned\n\nto multiple usage types. Permission groups are assigned at a core level but users/research\n\ngroups may be added per resource. For more information on specific calendar settings that have\n\nbeen updated, please see Schedule Settings. The first step in setting up resource calendars is to\n\ncreate permission groups. T hese permission groups will apply across all calendars and will be\n\ntied to usage types within each individual calendar. No more than 10 permission groups may be\n\nadded. To create a permission, navigate to the More button on the Schedule Equipment tab. Click\n\non Manage Permission Levels . A new interface will open. This new page will allow up to 10\n\npermissions to be created, edited, and deleted. All cores will have a Trained permission that can\n\nbe renamed, and each core is required to retain at least one permission level. The system will still\n\nutilize a level of Untrained which is not visible on this page. To add a new permission, click on\n\n'New Permission Level'. Add the name of the permission group and click 'Save'. Validations will\n\nensure permission names are not duplicated. The system will also ensure a permission is not\n\ndeleted if actively assigned to a group/ person or resource setting. The system will inform the user\n\nwhen this occurs, and the action button will be disabled. Once all permission levels have been\n\nadded, you can manage the permissions groups on the following interface. \n**Go to People Tab:**</source>\n\n<source id=\"2\">click on\n\n'New Permission Level'.

This section allows for you to set limitations and defaults around\n\nthose usage types to be applied to the calendar.

If this setting is turned off, the\n\ncustomer would need to schedule one event for each availability. Instructions for event availability\n\n: These instructions can be viewed in the reservations details screen when users are selecting an\n\navailability. \n**Use custom availabilities :**\n Turning this setting on allows for core staff and users to be\n\nable to schedules ad-hoc reservation at any open time on the calendar. This setting overrides\n\nother restrictions placed upon the calendar. Usage Types &amp; Pricing A usage type is a\n\npredefined reservation type created with specific scheduling and rate parameters. For example,\n\nyou may allow the usage type \"Independent User\" to schedule from 8am - 5pm, M-F and set the\n\ncost of usage during that time frame to a specific amount. Within each usage type, rates can be\n\nset differently for each price types (i.e.- external, internal, corporate) and can differ among\n\ndifferent usage types.</source>\n</context>\n<user_query>\nwhat are the steps to configure calendar permissions?\n</user_query>"

To configure calendar permissions, follow these steps:

1. **Create Permission Groups**:
   - Navigate to the "Schedule Equipment" tab and click on the "More" button.
   - Select "Manage Permission Levels" to open the interface for creating, editing, and deleting permissions.
   - Click "New Permission Level" to add a new permission group. Enter the name of the permission group and click "Save". Ensure the names are unique as validations will prevent duplicates [1].
   - Note that you can create up to 10 permission groups. The system will not allow deletion of permissions actively assigned to users or resources [1][2].

2. **Manage Permissions**:
   - Navigate to the "People" tab to bulk manage permissions for users and research groups [2].
   - Use the "Equipment Trainings" section to manage permissions for specific calendars [2].

3. **Edit and Organize Permissions**:
   - Use the blue edit pencil to modify permission names.
   - Click the "X" to delete permissions, but ensure they are not actively assigned to users or resources [2].
   - Drag and sort permissions using the three dots to adjust their order in selection lists (e.g., reservation details) [2].

4. **Assign Permissions to Usage Types**:
   - Permission groups are tied to usage types within individual calendars. This enables or limits access to the calendar based on the assigned group [1].

5. **Set Default Usage Types**:
   - Configure default usage types for users without permissions or for specific trained user groups in the availability settings section [3].

These steps will allow you to effectively configure and manage calendar permissions for your resources.

## Steps to Configure Calendar Permissions

### Prerequisites
- You must have Core Administrator access to manage permissions [2].
- Ensure that no more than 10 permission groups are created, as the system limits the number of permissions to 10 [2].

### Steps to Configure Calendar Permissions

#### 1. **Create Permission Groups**
   - Navigate to the **Schedule Equipment** tab and click on the **More** button [2].
   - Select **Manage Permission Levels**. This opens a new interface where permissions can be created, edited, or deleted [2].
   - Click on **New Permission Level** to add a new permission group [2].
     - Enter the name of the permission group and click **Save**.
     - Ensure the permission names are unique, as the system validates against duplicate names [2].
   - Note: If a permission group is actively assigned to a user, group, or resource setting, it cannot be deleted. The system will disable the delete action and notify the user [2].

#### 2. **Bulk Manage Permissions**
   - Navigate to the **People** tab to bulk manage permissions [2].

#### 3. **Assign Permissions to Calendars**
   - Go to the **Equipment Trainings** section and select a specific calendar [2].
   - Add permissions to the calendar by choosing the appropriate usage types and assigning them to the permission groups [2].

#### 4. **Organize Permission Groups**
   - Use the **Three Dots** icon to drag and sort the order of permissions. While permissions are not hierarchical, this affects how they appear in selection lists (e.g., reservation details for the calendar) [2].

#### 5. **Edit or Delete Permissions**
   - To edit a permission group, click the blue **Edit Pencil** icon and update the name [2].
   - To delete a permission group, click the **Delete X** icon. Note that permissions assigned to users or resources cannot be deleted [2].

### Verification
- Check the calendar settings to ensure the permissions are correctly applied to the intended usage types [2].
- Verify that the permissions appear in the correct order in selection lists [2].

### Troubleshooting
- If the **New Permission Level** button is grayed out, it indicates that the maximum limit of 10 permissions has been reached [2].
- If a permission group cannot be deleted, ensure it is not actively assigned to any user, group, or resource setting [2].

By following these steps, you can successfully configure calendar permissions to manage access and usage types effectively.

To set up a calendar, follow these steps:

1. **Access General Settings**:
   - Enter a name for the calendar.
   - Provide a description for the scheduled resource. This text will be displayed to customers on the calendar interface and can include explanations, images, billing information, or directions for scheduling [1].

2. **Categorize the Calendar**:
   - Use the "Category" dropdown to group calendars into categories. If needed, create a new category by selecting "Add new category" and typing the name. Note that additional settings may need to be enabled for category display [1].

3. **Set the Time Zone**:
   - Specify the time zone for scheduling purposes. By default, this will align with your institution's time zone, overriding the user's personal time zone settings [1].

4. **Add Notes and Instructions**:
   - Include calendar notes that will appear above the calendar on the View Schedule page.
   - Provide customer instructions for reservation details, which will be displayed at the top of the Reservation Details page [1].

5. **Configure Display Settings**:
   - Decide whether to scale the hour on the schedule to the minimum time step allowed.
   - Choose whether to display usage type names in the background of the calendar.
   - Set the default view to multi-view if multiple instances exist.
   - Allow users to see reservation owners if collaboration is encouraged [2].

6. **Set Public Visibility**:
   - Determine whether the schedule and its description should be visible to the public on your external landing page.
   - Decide if public users can view reservation owners [2].

7. **Define Restrictions**:
   - Set minimum and maximum reservation times.
   - Specify the time step increments for scheduling events [2].

8. **Advanced Attributes (Optional)**:
   - Enable advanced attributes if required. This allows you to create groupings and attributes for the calendar, such as mandatory selections or administrative-only visibility [3].

9. **Manage Events**:
   - Core staff can add events directly to the calendar, scheduling time on behalf of users if needed [4].

10. **Save Settings**:
    - Remember to save each editing panel individually after making changes [1].

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of setting up and configuring a calendar based on the provided context. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

## Guide to Setting Up a Calendar

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have access to the **Schedule Equipment tab** in iLab as a core administrator [4].
- Verify that any required advanced attributes are enabled by an iLab associate if needed [5].
- Familiarize yourself with the calendar settings and their functionalities, such as general settings, restrictions, and advanced attributes [5][4].

---

### General Settings
1. **Access Schedule Settings**: Navigate to the **Schedule Equipment tab** and click the blue pencil icon next to the **View Schedule** button to edit the calendar [4].
   
2. **Enter Basic Information**:
   - **Schedule Name**: Provide a name for the calendar [5].
   - **Scheduled Resource Description**: Add text that will be displayed to customers on the calendar interface. This can include explanations, images, billing details, or scheduling directions [5].
   - **Category**: Assign a category to group calendars. To create a new category, select "Add new category" from the dropdown menu and type the name of the category. Note: Contact iLab if you want categories displayed [5].
   - **Time Zone**: Set the time zone for scheduling purposes. This will override the user's personal time zone settings [5].
   - **Classification**: Assign a classification to the schedule for easier searching. Classification terms are derived from the Resource Ontology Set [5].

3. **Add Calendar Notes**: Include notes that will appear above the calendar on the **View Schedule** page [4].

4. **Customer Instructions**: Provide instructions for reservation details. These will be displayed at the top of the **Reservation Details** page [4].

---

### Calendar Display Settings
5. **Adjust Display Options**:
   - **Scale Hour on Schedule**: Check this box to scale the hour (y-axis) to the minimum time step allowed on the calendar [4].
   - **Display Usage Type Names**: Enable or disable the display of usage types as text in the background of the calendar [4].
   - **Default to Multi-View**: Indicate whether the default calendar view should display all calendars when multiple instances exist [4].
   - **Let Users See Reservation Owners**: Allow users to view the name and email of the person who created the reservation [4].

6. **Public Visibility**:
   - Choose whether to display the schedule, description, and availabilities on the core's external landing page [4].
   - Decide if public users can view reservation owners [4].

---

### Restrictions and Time Settings
7. **Set Time Restrictions**:
   - **Minimum Reservation Time**: Define the minimum time a customer can schedule in one session [4].
   - **Maximum Reservation Time**: Define the maximum time a customer can schedule in one session [4].
   - **Time Step**: Set the increment by which events can be increased or decreased [4].

---

### Advanced Attributes (Optional)
8. **Enable Advanced Attributes**:
   - If advanced attributes are turned on, click the **Advanced Attributes** button to configure requirements [5].
   - Set up attributes and groupings:
     - Add a grouping by typing a name and clicking "Add grouping."
     - Create attributes under each grouping by clicking "Add attribute." Provide a name, description, and selection options [5].
     - Toggle "Required" to make attributes mandatory or "Administrative only" to restrict visibility to core staff [5].

9. **Assign Attributes to a Resource Schedule**:
   - Use the **Advanced Scheduler** button to manage configurations.
   - Select the day and time slots to configure attributes [5].

---

### Verification
- Save each editing panel individually to ensure changes are applied [5][4].
- Confirm that the calendar displays correctly and that all settings, restrictions, and attributes are functioning as intended [4].
- Test the calendar interface to verify customer usability, including reservation creation and visibility settings [4][4].

---

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting
- If categories are not displaying, contact iLab to enable the necessary settings [5].
- Ensure advanced attributes are activated by an iLab associate if they are not visible [5].
- Double-check time zone settings to prevent scheduling conflicts [5].

By following these steps, you can successfully set up a calendar tailored to your core's needs.

The calendar system described in the context offers a variety of features for managing schedules and reservations effectively. Here are the key features:

1. **General Settings**:
   - You can name the calendar and provide a description for the scheduled resource, which is displayed to customers. This description can include explanations, images, billing information, or directions for scheduling [1].
   - Calendars can be grouped into categories, and new categories can be created. However, displaying calendars in categories requires additional settings enabled by iLab [1].
   - Time zones can be set for scheduling purposes, overriding users' personal time zone settings [1].
   - Classifications can be assigned to schedules to improve searchability [1].

2. **Calendar Notes and Instructions**:
   - Notes can be added to display above the calendar or on the Reservation Details page, providing instructions or special information for customers [1][2].

3. **Multiple Instances**:
   - Multiple calendars can be created for resources within a single interface, allowing users to view and schedule across all instances simultaneously. For example, separate rows can be created for different equipment like "PCR 1," "PCR 2," etc. [2].

4. **Custom Forms**:
   - Custom forms can be linked to schedules to capture preliminary information from customers. These forms can be required or optional and can be displayed during reservations or maintenance scheduling [2].

5. **Notifications**:
   - Reminder emails can be sent to users prior to their reservations, with customizable timing [2].

6. **Calendar Display Options**:
   - Features like scaling hours, displaying usage type names, and defaulting to multi-view are available to customize the calendar display [4].

IMPROVED RESPONSE:
================================================================================
The calendar features include various functionalities to manage and customize scheduling effectively:

1. **General Settings**:
   - **Name**: You can assign a name to the calendar.
   - **Scheduled Resource Description**: This section can be used to provide explanations, images, billing information, or directions related to the resource [5].
   - **Category**: Calendars can be grouped into categories. New categories can be created, but additional settings may need to be enabled by contacting iLab [5].
   - **Time Zone**: The calendar's time zone can be set to override users' personal time zones [5].
   - **Classification**: Assign classifications to schedules for easier searching [5].
   - **Calendar Notes**: Notes can be added to display above the calendar on the View Schedule page [5].

2. **Multiple Instances**:
   - Allows creating multiple calendars within a single interface for resources like equipment. For example, separate rows for "PCR 1", "PCR 2", etc., can be configured [4].

3. **Custom Forms**:
   - Custom forms can be linked to schedules to capture preliminary information from users during reservations. These forms can be required or optional [4].

4. **Notifications**:
   - Reminder emails can be sent to users before their reservations, with customizable timing [4].

5. **Display Options**:
   - You can scale the hour on the schedule, display usage type names in the background, and set the default view to multi-view for multiple instances [4].
   - Public visibility settings allow the schedule and its details to be displayed on external landing pages [4].

6. **Restrictions**:
   - Minimum and maximum reservation times can be set, along with time step increments for scheduling [4].

7. **Usage Types & Pricing**:
   - Usage types define specific scheduling and rate parameters, such as "Independent User" or "Peak Hours." Rates can vary based on price classes (e.g., external, internal) and can include discounted rates for longer durations [4].

8. **Equipment Settings**:
   - Features like Confirm Usage, Calendar Notes, and Time Frame views (Day, Week, Month, Multi View) are available. Multi View allows users to see all instances of a resource on a single schedule [5].
   - Events are color-coded for easier identification (e.g., green for future reservations, purple for past reservations, red for unavailable equipment) [5].

Problems occurred when the pump was passing the test barely but well within the limits but the System\nPressure Test for the complete system failed because the Sampler or the?TCC were adding?tiny leaks to the\noverall?result\n\n**Steps to Follow:**\n\nSystem Pressure Test for 1200/1260/1290 Infinity?and 1290 Infinity II Pumps?With the release of LabAdvisor\nB.02.06 the limits for the System Pressure Test were raised depending on the pressure tested. For systems\ntested between 1 bar and 1000 bar the limit is set to 5 ?L. For systems tested >1000 bar the limit is set to 15\n?L accounting for increased stress on fittings, seals and valves.\nSee also service note 1290-015\n\n**Potential risks:**\n\nNA\n\n**Keywords:**\n?System pressure test, test limit\n\n**Article Author:**\n?Steve Zhang\n\nPage 1/1</source>\n\n<source id=\"4\">Service Note\n\nService Note\n\n**Document Information:**\n \nProduct Identifier G6917 RapID Raman\n\nProduct Revision N/A\n\nDocument Number D0025189\n\n**Document Change Log:**\n\nDate Reason for Update\n\nInitial release\n\nService Note Details\n\nTitle: Protocols Released to the Field Portal\n\n**Summary:**\n RapID Service Protocol and Calibration Work Instructions have been\n\nreleased onto the Field Portal\n\n**Parts required:**\n N/A\n\n**Situation/Problem:**\n RapID Service Protocol, Calibration, Test Piece Certification Work\n\nInstructions have been released onto the Field Portal.\n\nThe Service Protocol and Test Piece Certification hasn\u2019t changed beyond\n\ngetting a new document number and some colours updated.\n\nThe calibration work instructions has gone through a re-work into a new\n\nstyle and is released along side a new tool referenced in a secondary\n\nService Note D0025190\n\n**Solution/Action:**\n \n**Released as:**\n\n**D0025048 :**\n RapID System Test Piece Certification\n\n**D0025083 :**\n RapID Service Protocol\n\n**D0025085 :**\n RapID Calibration\n\n**Additional Information:**\n No additional training is required to implement the changes described in\n\nthis Service Note\n\n**Attachments:**\n (optional) N/A\n\n**Template Effective Date:**\n 23-\n**Dec-2020   Printed Date:**\n 4-Jun-2021\n\nPage 1 of 1 Agilent Technologies Restricted\n\nPLC Service Note BQ07.T19 (Rev.
