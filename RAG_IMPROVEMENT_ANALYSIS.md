# RAG Improvement Analysis

## Problem Statement

The original RAG system had issues with procedural content, such as step-by-step instructions. The response from the example query "how to add a new calendar?" demonstrates these issues:

1. The response lacks a clear, logical step-by-step structure
2. Important details from the source documentation are omitted
3. The hierarchical nature of procedures is not preserved
4. The system doesn't distinguish between procedural and informational queries

## Implemented Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to improve the RAG system's handling of procedural content:

1. **Semantic Chunking**: Documents are now chunked by semantic boundaries (headers, sections, steps) to preserve structure
2. **Procedural Content Detection**: The system can now identify when content contains procedural elements
3. **Hierarchical Retrieval**: Search results are reorganized to preserve document hierarchy
4. **Context Preparation Enhancements**: Procedural content is formatted differently to maintain structure
5. **Query Type Detection**: The system detects if a query is asking for procedural information
6. **Specialized System Prompts**: Different prompts are used for procedural vs. informational queries

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1 (Completed)**: Improved Chunking Strategy
   - Implemented semantic chunking to preserve document structure
   - Added procedural content detection
   - Added metadata extraction for chunks

2. **Phase 2 (Completed)**: Context Preparation Enhancements
   - Reorganized search results to preserve hierarchy
   - Implemented prioritization of procedural content
   - Added metadata to source tags for better content identification
   - Enhanced formatting for procedural content to maintain structure

3. **Phase 3 (Completed)**: System Prompt Improvements
   - Enhanced query type detection with pattern matching and context awareness
   - Implemented specialized prompts for procedural vs. informational queries
   - Added support for follow-up questions in procedural contexts
   - Improved prompt selection logic based on query type

4. **Phase 4-6 (Planned)**: Response Validation, Metadata-Enhanced Retrieval, Integration and Testing

## Example Improvement

### Original Response
```
To add a new calendar, follow these steps:

1. Enter Basic Information: Provide a name for the calendar and a description of the scheduled resource. The description can include details such as an explanation of the resource, an image, billing information, or scheduling directions [2].

2. Set the Category: You can group calendars into categories. To create a new category, click on the category dropdown and select "Add new category." This will allow you to type in the name of the new category. Note that if you want your calendars displayed in categories, you may need to contact iLab to enable an additional setting [2].

3. Define the Time Zone: Enter the time zone for scheduling purposes. By default, this will be set to your institution's time zone, overriding the user's personal time zone setting [2].

4. Assign Classification: Assign a classification to the schedule to make it easier to search. Available classification terms are derived from the Eagle I Resource Ontology Set [2].

5. Add Notes and Instructions: You can add calendar notes that will display above the calendar on the View Schedule page. Additionally, you can provide customer instructions for reservation details, which will appear at the top of the Reservation Details page [2].

# How to Add a New Calendar

## Basic Information
1. Enter a name for the calendar
2. Provide a description of the scheduled resource
   - Include explanation of the resource
   - Add an image if needed
   - Include billing information
   - Add scheduling directions

## Category Settings
1. Click in the category dropdown
2. Select "Add new category"
3. Type the name of the new category in the text field
4. Note: Contact iLab if you want calendars displayed in categories

## Time and Classification
1. Set the time zone for scheduling purposes
   - Default is your institution's time zone
   - This overrides user's personal time zone setting
2. Assign a classification to the schedule
   - Classification terms come from Eagle I Resource Ontology Set

## Additional Settings
1. Add calendar notes
   - These display above the calendar on the View Schedule page
2. Add customer instructions for reservation details
   - These appear at the top of the Reservation Details page
```

## Testing and Comparison

The implementation includes:

1. A test script (`test_rag_improvement.py`) to verify the implementation
2. A comparison script (`compare_rag_implementations.py`) to compare the original and improved RAG implementations
3. Shell scripts to run the tests and start the improved RAG system

## Next Steps

1. Add Response Validation and Post-Processing (Phase 4)
   - Validate that procedural responses include all necessary steps
   - Enhance formatting of procedural responses
   - Implement post-processing to ensure consistent structure
   - Add verification of citation accuracy and completeness

2. Enhance Retrieval with Metadata (Phase 5)
   - Use extracted metadata to improve search relevance
   - Implement metadata-based ranking of results
   - Add weighting for procedural content in relevant queries
   - Develop specialized retrieval strategies for different query types

3. Perform comprehensive testing and fine-tuning (Phase 6)
   - Compare original and improved implementations
   - Gather user feedback on response quality
   - Conduct A/B testing with real users
   - Fine-tune parameters based on performance metrics

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Procedural responses include clear, numbered steps
2. The hierarchical structure of procedures is preserved
3. All critical information from the source documentation is included
4. The system properly distinguishes between procedural and informational queries
5. Response quality is improved as measured by user feedback
