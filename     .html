Adjust Batch Size: Increase the batch size for the trashcan cleaner job to delete more files per batch. For example, increasing the batch size to 50,000 files can help expedite the cleanup process and reduce the duration significantly [1].2. Modify Cleanup Frequency: Configure settings to run cleanup jobs more frequently. This ensures that stale tickets or deleted data are processed faster [1].3. Restart Services: After modifying these settings, restart the `alfrescoTomcat` service to apply changes effectively [1].4. Use Configuration Utility: Access the server and use a configuration utility to make necessary adjustments to settings related to cleanup jobs [1].5. Empty Trash Manually (if needed): If files are moved to Alfresco&#x27;s trash can during deletion, ensure you manually empty it within Alfresco for permanent removal of stale tickets or data [2]. Be cautious as this action is irreversible.These steps should help streamline and accelerate the cleanup process for stale ECMXT tickets while maintaining system efficiency.

                    <div class="truncate-text" title="The 48V error on the ICP-MS instrument, specifically a 7850 model, indicates an issue with the +48V power supply to the Quadrupole (QP) system. This error prevents startup or tuning of the instrument and typically arises due to a hardware malfunction in either the QP Tank PCA or QP Controller PCA.### Explanation of Error:The error occurs when the +48V power supply is not detected while connected to the QP Tank PCA. However, when disconnected, voltage readings show that +48V is present. This suggests that there is no issue with the power supply itself but rather with one of the boards responsible for managing this voltage.### Root Cause:- Faulty QP Driver Board: Either the QP Tank PCA or QP Controller PCA could be defective.- Ribbon Cable Damage: The main ribbon cable connecting the controller board to other components may have a burned-out red strip.- Feedback Error: A feedback mechanism failure might prevent proper voltage detection.### Steps to Fix:1. Check Ribbon Cable: Inspect the main ribbon cable from the main board to controller for any visible damage (e.g., burned-out sections).2. Test Boards Separately:   - Disconnect and test both QP Tank PCA and QP Controller PCA using another working ICP-MS instrument (e.g., another 7850 model).   - Identify which board fails during testing.3. Replace Faulty Component:   - If testing confirms that either QP Tank PCA or Controller PCA is faulty, order replacements for these parts.4. Verify Voltage Readings:   - Ensure +48V is consistently supplied after replacing faulty components by checking through maintenance screen settings.5. Reassemble and Test Instrument:   - Reconnect all cables and boards properly.   - Perform startup and tuning procedures to confirm functionality.### Spare Parts Required:Based on troubleshooting steps outlined above, you may need to order:1. QP Tank PCA – Replacement part if this board is identified as faulty.2. QP Controller PCA – Replacement part if this board fails during testing.3. Main Ribbon Cable – Order if physical inspection reveals damage such as burns or breaks in connectivity.By systematically following these steps, you should be able to resolve this issue even without prior engineering experience [1].
