1. **Reagent Preparation**:
   - Were the reagents thawed and vortexed properly before use? [1], [2]
   - Were the reagents centrifuged to ensure all liquid was at the bottom of the wells? [2]
   - Did the user visually check the reagents and consumables for any damage or abnormalities before loading them onto the deck? [2]

2. **Environmental Conditions**:
   - Was the Magnis instrument operated within the recommended environmental conditions (15-25°C and 30%-70% humidity)? [1]
   - Were there any signs of low humidity that might cause intermittent failures? [1]

3. **Consumable Placement**:
   - Were the consumables placed on the deck correctly following the touchscreen instructions? [1], [2]
   - Did the user check the seal of the Beads & Buffer Plate for warping, bulging, or other abnormalities before starting the run? [1]

4. **Input DNA/RNA Quality**:
   - Was the input DNA/RNA sample volume, concentration, and quality verified against the guidelines in the SureSelect on Magnis User Guides? [4]
   - If enzymatic shearing was performed, was the DNA input volume set to 14 µl, and was the shearing time adjusted appropriately? [4]

5. **Probe and Hybridization Setup**:
   - Were the correct probes used for the region of interest? [4]
   - Was the probe volume accurately dispensed into the probe strip using an appropriate pipette? [4]

6. **Quantification and QC**:
   - Was the quantification of the input samples performed correctly, and were the consumables used for quantification in optimal condition? [2], [4]
   - Were QC checks performed on the input DNA/RNA after shearing but before loading onto the Magnis? [4]

Q2: No sample preparation issues were discovered. What could be the next steps?
A2: If no sample preparation issues were identified, the next steps should focus on other potential causes for the lack of final libraries. Here are the recommended actions:

1. **Instrument Setup and Operation**:
   - Verify that the consumables were placed correctly on the deck according to the touchscreen instructions [1].
   - Check the environmental operating conditions (temperature and humidity) to ensure they meet the recommended range (15-25°C and 30%-70% humidity) [1].
   - Perform an auto-teach procedure to ensure the instrument's alignment is correct. If auto-teach fails, an on-site visit by an engineer may be required to re-align the Z gantry and pipette [3].

2. **Hardware Inspection**:
   - Inspect the instrument for any hardware issues, such as deformation of pipette module barrels or incorrect Z belt tension, which could cause intermittent failures [3].
   - Check for proper sealing of the Beads & Buffer Plate to rule out leakage or evaporation issues [1], [4].

3. **Reagent and Consumable Quality**:
   - Confirm that the reagents and consumables used were from the correct lot and stored under appropriate conditions [3], [4].
   - Check for discrepancies in residual volumes in reagent plates after the run, as this could indicate issues with reagent usage or evaporation [4].

4. **Run Diagnostics**:
   - Review the Magnis log files and tip lot numbers used during the problematic runs to identify any patterns or errors [1].
   - Ask the user to provide pictures of the deck setup, reagent plates, and final library strip for further analysis [1], [3].

5. **Repeat the Run**:
   - If possible, perform a repeat run using a reference sample to prevent loss of patient samples and to identify any recurring issues [4].
   - Ensure the user follows all setup and preparation instructions meticulously during the repeat run.

6. **Consult Technical Support**:
   - If the issue persists, escalate the case to Agilent technical support for further troubleshooting and potentially schedule an on-site visit by a field service engineer (FSE) [1], [3].

By systematically addressing these areas, you can identify and resolve potential causes beyond sample preparation.
