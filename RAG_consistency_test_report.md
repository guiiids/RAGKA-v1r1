# RAG Consistency Test Report

## Overview

This report documents the results of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) consistency tests conducted on our system. The tests evaluate the system's ability to provide consistent, accurate, and high-quality responses across different domains and in multi-turn conversations.

## Test Methodology

### Test Cases

The test suite includes predefined test cases from the UAT document, covering multiple domains:
- Genomics
- GC (Gas Chromatography)
- LC (Liquid Chromatography)
- iLab
- OpenLab CDS

Each test case consists of:
- An initial query
- A follow-up query that builds on the context of the initial query
- Expected responses for both queries
- Required phrases that must be present in the responses

### Evaluation Approach

The evaluation uses a two-tier approach:

1. **Phrase-Based Validation**
   - Automated checking for required phrases in responses
   - Ensures critical information is included
   - Fast and deterministic

2. **LLM-Based Semantic Evaluation**
   - Uses an LLM to compare actual vs. expected responses
   - Evaluates semantic similarity beyond exact phrase matching
   - Provides scores for:
     - Overall similarity
     - Information completeness
     - Accuracy
     - Structure
     - Clarity
